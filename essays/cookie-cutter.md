### I want to make a cookie

Imagine making a chocolate chip cookie from scratch. Without looking at a recipe, you could probably guess what kind of ingredients you'd need based on what you already know about a cookie. For example, I could probably guess that I'd need some flour, eggs, chocolate chips and butter. But how much do I need of each? 

Without a recipe it'd be kind of hard to prepare this. I could throw all the ingredients together and conduct an experiment where I pray each time that the next outcome will be the one that I want, but of course while mixing it up, maybe one trial I'll pray on a carpet, the next I'll pray on the toilet, each in hope that the next will turn out different and become the cookie that I want. Several trials in, I'll realize it's not retaining it's shape because I'm missing an ingredient I didn't even know I needed (baking soda). Sounds kind of tedious and redundant though right? How do I fix what I'm doing wrong? How do I speed up the development process of making my chocolate chip cookie? I have the right ingredients but somehow my process is wrong but I don't know where. 

### Recipes. Blueprints. Cookie Cutters. 

How do I produce the cookie that I want and be confident in replicating it? This is where design patterns come in. Design patterns in software engineering is a general solution that can speed up the development process, with basically a cookie cutter pattern. It's a template that can be used to solve problems of different contexts. Going back to my post [Familiarity in Formatting](https://larissa-tsai.github.io/essays/familiarity-in-formatting.html), we use coding structures (and design patterns) to follow a general outline and provide structure. This also allows code readability and organization.
