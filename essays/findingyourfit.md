> *She tasted the large bowl and said, “This porridge is too salty!” She tasted the medium bowl and said, “This porridge is too sweet!” She tasted the small bowl and said, “This is porridge is just right.” - Goldilocks and the Three Bears*

The world of computers is SO incredibly broad, and technology has gotten so advance (even more still, it's still advancing!), it's everywhere, and the uses for a computer are not limited to one, as it's infinitely broad. You're interested in computers? Well what part? Software, hardware, game development, cybersecurity, web app and design, data science, artificial intelligence, graphics, algorithms...and etc, well you get the gist. So at this point, you know I'm interested in getting a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. But what exactly do I want to do with that degree once I graduate?...well, I guess you can say I'm still trying to figure that part out for myself. 

Since the realm of computers is so large, how do I find what fits me and my passions? Like Goldilocks, I guess you can say I've been dipping my spoon into a few bowls to find the right fit for me! I can say now that I have been very fortunate to have had two internships, one in Network Engineering that allowed me to work with a team within the IT infrastructure of a bank organization and watch how they maintained network connectivity and router configurations. My other internship was in Cybersecurity, and it allowed me to learn about the Linux OS and get familiar with Virtual Machines. Growing up, I feel like there's always this pressure for people to know and be sure of what they want to do, in my life, I received that pressure from high school counselors, teachers, parents, peers...etc. But how does anyone know if anything is the right fit for them if they don't try it out? I mean, I started my college career majoring in Chinese! Now here is I am scoping out Software Engineering. 

As I explore and walk through software engineering, I hope I can find something that allows me to explore my creative side, since I like to create and design and make art, but also challenge the analytical/logical side of my brain. An aspect of computer science that initially drew me in was that with coding, there are several ways to approach a problem, and in that space from where you start and analyze a problem to where you arrive at the solution, there's this window that allows room for creativity, but not just in coding! In software engineering nearly everything runs on software. In working with a huge variety of devices, there's a step in the process that focuses on concept creation and the development of visuals and graphics, and it is what I would like to expand on someday or generally build skills towards. I look forward to diversifying the systems and technologies I get to work with/on, and how to navigate them.
