Computer Science wasn't my first choice. I graduated from my high school as my class's leading valedictorian, many could say that I was an accomplished individual, but really I was just kind of ... lost. I didn't quite know what I wanted to do with my future. My main goal was pretty straightforward and that was to graduate high school and go to college. My parents never got that opportunity so by doing so I was fulfilling their ideas of success and the "American Dream." Because I grew up with my parents pressuring focus on assimilating, I felt like I lost touch with my culture, and without knowing what else I wanted to do in life, I just ended up majoring in Chinese. 

But then on the side, I ended up taking a simple and easy IT course in python. It was simple but it was fun, and I found myself actually liking the class a lot and coding. I ended up switching majors in my second year and found myself pursuing a new passion in computer science. I am fairly new though and lack experience, so when I switched majors and was suddenly taking classes on Java and C/C++, I found that learning new programming languages can be quite difficult! Python was so easy! However after finishing those classes and now learning Javascript in our modules on FreeCodeCamp, I found that it was surprisingly really easy to pick up. The modules were interactive, and you could instantly apply what you've just learned after each course. I think in another perspective, perhaps it was easier to pick up because now I am  how far I had come in my coding journey, albeit not at a mastery level, I am no longer struggling as much as when I first started! In comparison, I feel like Javascript is a lot more straightforward and beginner friendly. It's flexible and adaptable and it definitely simplified and condensed a lot of the commands we type, which fits well with software engineering in my opinion.

Something I look forward to is our "Workout of the Day" (WODs) where we utilize what we've learned in short coding exercises that generally take at most 15 minutes to complete. The thing that first appealed to me about computer science was the sense of satisfaction coding gave me. It's like a puzzle, and it can be frustrating to solve if the answer doesn't seem straightforward, but it makes the satisfaction that much more lasting when you've struggled through to solve it. I typically like learning this way because rather than learning through a textbook or lecture, I can actively apply what I learn immediately and run through it multiple times as needed for my own personal practice!
