I graduated from my high school as my class's leading valedictorian, many could say that I was an accomplished individual, but really I was just kind of ... lost. I didn't quite know what I wanted to do with my future. My main goal was pretty straightforward and that was to graduate high school and go to college. My parents never got that opportunity so by doing so I was fulfilling their ideals of an "American Dream." Because I grew up with a focus on assimilating, I felt like I lost touch with my culture and without knowing what else I wanted to do in life, I just ended up majoring in Chinese.

On the side I took an easy Information and Technology's couse in python, it was simple but it was fun, and I found that I actually like coding. I ended up switching majors and found a new passion in computer science. I am fairly new and lack experience, so when I switched majors and was suddenly taking classes on Java and C/C++, I found learning new programming languages difficult! However learning Javascript in our modules was so easy! I liked how interactive the program was, and how you could instantly apply it after each course. I think in some ways, it also made me realize how far I had come in my coding journey, albeit not at a mastery level, I am no longer struggling as much as when I first started! In comparison, I feel like Javascript is a lot more straightforward and beginner friendly. It's flexible and adaptable and it definitely simplified and condensed a lot of the commands we type, which fits well with software engineering in my opinion.

Something I look forward to is our "Workout of the Day" (WODs) where we utilize what we've learned in short coding exercises that generally take at most 15 minutes to complete. The thing that first appealed to me about computer science was the sense of satisfaction coding gave me. It's like a puzzle, and it can be frustrating to solve if the answer doesn't seem straightforward, but it makes the satisfaction that much more lasting when you've struggled through to solve it. I typically like learning this way because rather than learning through a textbook or lecture, I can actively apply what I learn immediately and run through it multiple times as needed for my own personal practice!
