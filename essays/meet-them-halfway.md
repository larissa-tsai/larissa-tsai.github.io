### I want it, and I want it now

Good, honest, and expressive communication, is by far, such a widely useful skill to master and continuously develop. You need communication in everything: the relationships that you build with your family, your friends, your partner, and even as a student! Nowadays in our upcoming society where everything is just *snap* instant, you learn that a lot of people are starting to lose patience for things. Why would they need to, when normally things like calling a taxi is just a click away? ...Getting updates on someone is just a scroll away on their socials? When getting an answer to something is just a type away into a search bar? There's always a need to be on the go, to be productive, to be busy, or to not have time or patience to sit down and do things thouroughly, because we want them done in *snap* instances, and we're used to getting them all in, well, instances. 


### There are no stupid questions...well I beg to differ

Nowadays all the answers you need are available to you on the internet with a search away. Although a powerful tool, it can quite easily become a crutch for people who don't really want to put effort into learning or understanding the concepts, but only want an instant answer for a graded assignment or to pass a class. A quick deviation, but you know how in high school, some of your teachers would say, *"Come on now, don't be shy, if you don't know something or you don't understand something, ask. There are no stupid questions."* Well I beg to differ, and so would Eric Raymond. In [*How to ask questions the smart way*](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) he talks a little bit about how software engineers love a good stimulus, it's the hard questions that provoke thought and exercise the brain, and in general provide questions in a public space for people with shared technical interests to be inspired and collaborate. *Instead* these forums end up being demeaned by "people who seem to be unwilling to think or to do their own homework before asking questions." These ignorant questions can take away time and space from genuine people with an interest in learning the technical details behind how a program works and not just simply to find a quick "answer," because they couldn't be bothered to read through and do a quick self-initiated research. 

Funny story, I once had a psychology teacher that used the previous phrase with a twist, he used to say, "There are no stupid questions, only stupid people," and at the time, I thought this phrase was kind of mean to say to a group of developing high school teens, but after reading [*How to ask questions the smart way*](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) I can kind of see how it relates. The stupid people are the lazy people. They avoid struggle and stay stuck. Even if you lack knowledge, you will never be stupid as long as you're willing to accept the struggle and continuously seeking for ways to get better and learn from it.

### Acknowledging the Struggle
So now you're probably wondering, "Larissa you've been going on about stupid people and stupid questions, well what does a smart question even look like then??" Good question! Some of the precepts to a smart question at the very least is an attempt to do some research on the question beforehand, try to find the answer elsewhere, it might have already been posted. Then, if you haven't found anything about it, demonstrate or communicate what you *have* learned in your attempt to research it. It gives people a baseline for what you do know about it. Try to do some thinking on your own, and let it marinate before giving up and rushing to ask after a failed research attempt. This one seems like a no-brainer, but put thought into your question! Think before you phrase it and do some research on any assumptions. 

Below I have an example of a [smart question.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10116961/can-you-explain-the-httpurlconnection-connection-process?noredirect=1&lq=1) This person thoroughly communicates their background on the subjecty and what they are trying to do, which is using HTTPURLConnection to connect a web service. Then they communicate the areas of struggle, which is understanding the logistical areas/points of connection. The questions where they phrased their area of struggle, shows that they *actually* know a decent amount about it already, did research beforehand, and show willingness to put in effort to learn. The question also pertains to the subject and isn't a desparate cry for help. If you look at some of the replies, because they also communicated effectively their question and confusion, there were very willing replies to their struggle to break down their confusion and look at it in simple terms. 


### Too lazy to struggle
This here is an example of a [stupid question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3295496/what-is-a-javabean-exactly?rq=1). A lot of what this person is asking is definition questions or functionality questions that could easily have been searched for in the Java API Documentation.
