I worked as a temporary hire as a Network Engineer at American Savings bank at their campus center in downtown Honolulu. While I was there, a really cool and exciting project I got to learn/work on was configuring CISCO 4200 Routers that would actually be sent off to the American Saving Branches between the islands on Hawaii. In total I worked to configure around four large routers. 

I used remote desk connections and applications like SecureCRT and putty. As well as the components to configuration, and how to ping the router network IP address for availability and use, and the ATM ip network and what each section does. Not only did I learn how to configure it online on these applications, I also learned how to physically set up the device and the hardware components, and how to emplace a wireless LTE chip that would tunnel to the LTE router site (making it wireless). 

In the learning experience, because these are actual routers that are used in the branch, and a focus in network engineering is also the security of our network devices, I accidentally, in the configuration wrote the encrypted password, but forgot to write in the component in the configuration that would accept the encrypted password! So we were basically locked out from access into the router. In debugging the configuration process it set the team back in production for another day, and I had to code a reset.
