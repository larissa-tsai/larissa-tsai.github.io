The Pokedex program is a GUI Pokemon game that I helped create as a team project for ICS 211, Fall 2020. This project was a comprehensive learning checkpoint that utilized all the skills that we learned that semester with Java and applications. We were allowed to be creative and design the application as we wanted.

Our Pokedex is implemented using [jGrasp](https://www.jgrasp.org/), development environment in Java coding language, that allows us to create software visualizations. We also collaborated with teammates through gitHub and did peer code review. In the upper portion of the program we wrote code to "Hunt" or "Catch" pokemon. We used learned data structures to store Pokemon, and wrote code that would display information like a Pokedex, about the Pokemon in the lower portion of our GUI program.
